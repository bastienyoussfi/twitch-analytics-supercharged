Project Overview:
We need a responsive, outstanding, and clean UI for a web application that analyzes and showcases trending Twitch streamers and their clips. The design should be built using shadcn components (https://ui.shadcn.com/) and must align with a dark theme aesthetic. We want a purple-forward color palette that resonates with Twitch’s brand style—modern, bold, yet minimalistic enough to ensure a pleasant, intuitive user experience.

Key Requirements:

Visual Style & Branding
Dark theme as the primary style, leveraging deep grays and blacks for backgrounds.
Vibrant purple accents (similar to Twitch’s signature purple) for interactive elements, highlights, and call-to-action buttons.
Use of clean, modern typography that ensures high contrast and legibility in dark mode.
Subtle gradients, glows, or geometric shapes that enhance the “gaming/streaming” vibe without overwhelming the UI.
Layout & Navigation
A responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
A prominent sidebar or top navigation (depending on best UX) with intuitive icons and labels for sections like Dashboard, Analytics, Clips, Trending, and Settings.
Clear hierarchy of content: primary content area for main analytics and leaderboards, secondary panels for filters or user interactions.
A collapsible menu or hamburger icon on mobile to keep the interface clean.
Core Screens & Components
Dashboard Page: Display key metrics (e.g., total rising streamers, daily viewer spikes, trending clips). Include cards or widgets for quick stats.
Trending/Leaderboard Page: A clean leaderboard view that ranks streamers, showing profile images, follower counts, average viewers, and short trending indicators (arrows, color-coded changes).
Clip Analysis Page: Thumbnails of clips with play buttons, brief stats (views, likes, date created). Possibly show a small preview modal on hover or click.
Streamer Details Page: Deeper analytics (graphs for viewership over time, follower growth, chat sentiment, etc.), plus a user-friendly filter bar to change timeframes.
Settings/User Profile: Basic user account management, subscription info, notifications settings, etc.
Interactivity & User Experience
Use shadcn components for consistent styling (e.g., buttons, modals, tabs, accordions).
Incorporate micro-interactions or subtle animations (hover states, transitions on modal open/close) to enhance the premium feel.
Provide clear call-to-action elements (e.g., “View More Clips,” “Upgrade Plan,” “Share,” “Filter by Date Range”).
Ensure forms and data input elements (filters, search bars) are accessible and visually distinct.
Responsiveness & Accessibility
Each screen should look and function well on large monitors down to small mobile devices.
Maintain at least AA contrast ratios for text on dark backgrounds.
Use accessible color contrasts for buttons, links, and hover states, especially with purple highlights.
Overall Mood & Inspiration
Channel the feel of Twitch’s brand (playful yet sleek, gamer-centric, high contrast, energetic purple) without directly copying.
Refer to the attached moodboard or reference image for general layout inspiration, focusing on a dark UI with purple highlights, clear typography, and bold data visualization.
Deliverables
High-fidelity design mockups for desktop and mobile breakpoints, including all core screens.
Style guidelines for color palette (hex or RGBA values), typography, spacing, and component usage.
Interaction notes or prototypes demonstrating hover states, transitions, and any animation details.
Objective:
Create an intuitive, visually striking dark-themed UI using shadcn. Make it easy for users to navigate analytics, discover rising streamers, and explore viral clips. Emphasize a clean layout with strategic use of purple accents, ensuring a premium, gamer-oriented vibe.

Please generate detailed UI mockups or a structured component library that meets these specifications. The final design should feel polished, cohesive, and ready for development with shadcn + Tailwind CSS.
